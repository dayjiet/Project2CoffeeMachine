## Description
The Coffee Machine project is a Java program that simulates a coffee machine. The purpose of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for ordering various types of coffee, managing the inventory of ingredients, and handling monetary transactions. The project demonstrates the implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes, class methods, and attributes, using Java programming language.

## Features

The Coffee Machine project offers the following features:

- Buying Coffee: Users can choose from three types of coffee - espresso, cappuccino, and latte. The program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee beans, and cups) to prepare the selected coffee and deducts the required amounts from the inventory. If there are insufficient resources, appropriate error messages are displayed.
- Filling Resources: Users can add additional amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and cups to replenish the inventory of the coffee machine.
- Taking Cash: Users can retrieve the accumulated cash from the coffee machine. The program resets the cash amount to zero after the cash has been taken.
- Checking Remaining Resources: Users can view the current inventory of the coffee machine, including the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, cups, and the total cash.

## Usage

To use the Coffee Machine program, follow these steps:

1. Execute the CoffeeMachine class's main method, which acts as the entry point for the program.
2. The program will display a menu with different actions that can be performed.
3. Enter the desired action by typing the corresponding command:
- To buy coffee, enter buy.
- To fill the resources, enter fill.
- To take cash, enter take.
- To check the remaining resources, enter remaining.
- To exit the program, enter exit.
4. Follow the prompts and enter the required information based on the selected action.
5. The program will perform the specified action and return to the main menu for further interactions.
   
To run the Project2CoffeeMachine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file, perform the following steps:

1. Download the JAR file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt: Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located.
3. Run the JAR file: Enter the following command to execute the JAR file:
```shell
java -jar Project2CoffeeMachine-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions: The program will display a menu with different options. Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action.

## Feedback
Throughout the Coffee Machine project, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) and its fundamental concepts, including classes, class methods, and attributes, while strengthening my Java skills. This project provided me with ample opportunities to practice working with methods, challenge myself with loops and conditions, and enhance my overall confidence with OOP.

One of the main challenges I encountered was managing the inventory of the coffee machine and displaying notifications when certain ingredients ran out. To overcome this, I implemented appropriate logic to track the availability of products and prompt users when supplies were low.

Additionally, implementing the functionality to collect money and dispense different types of coffee presented an interesting problem to solve. I successfully integrated payment processing and coffee selection mechanisms, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Overall, this project was instrumental in improving my grasp of OOP principles and sharpening my programming skills in Java. It provided an engaging opportunity to simulate a coffee machine and further developed my proficiency in working with methods, loops, and conditions. I now feel more equipped to tackle complex programming tasks and apply OOP concepts in future projects.
