## Description
The Coffee Machine project is a Java program that simulates a coffee machine. The purpose of the project is to provide a user-friendly interface for ordering various types of coffee, managing the inventory of ingredients, and handling monetary transactions. The project demonstrates the implementation of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes, class methods, and attributes, using Java programming language.

## Features

The Coffee Machine project offers the following features:

- Buying Coffee: Users can choose from three types of coffee - espresso, cappuccino, and latte. The program checks if there are enough resources (water, milk, coffee beans, and cups) to prepare the selected coffee and deducts the required amounts from the inventory. If there are insufficient resources, appropriate error messages are displayed.
- Filling Resources: Users can add additional amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and cups to replenish the inventory of the coffee machine.
- Taking Cash: Users can retrieve the accumulated cash from the coffee machine. The program resets the cash amount to zero after the cash has been taken.
- Checking Remaining Resources: Users can view the current inventory of the coffee machine, including the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, cups, and the total cash.

## Usage

To use the Coffee Machine program, follow these steps:

1. Execute the CoffeeMachine class's main method, which acts as the entry point for the program.
2. The program will display a menu with different actions that can be performed.
3. Enter the desired action by typing the corresponding command:
- To buy coffee, enter buy.
- To fill the resources, enter fill.
- To take cash, enter take.
- To check the remaining resources, enter remaining.
- To exit the program, enter exit.
4. Follow the prompts and enter the required information based on the selected action.
5. The program will perform the specified action and return to the main menu for further interactions.

## Feedback
During the development of the Simple Banking System project, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and strengthened my knowledge of Java programming. Through this project, I had the opportunity to apply OOP concepts such as classes, class methods, and attributes, which helped me organize the code and improve code reusability.

One of the main challenges I encountered was designing the structure of the banking system and implementing the necessary functionalities. I had to carefully plan the class hierarchy, ensuring that each class had clear responsibilities and that they interacted correctly. Additionally, I had to handle user input, validate it, and perform appropriate actions based on the user's choices.

To overcome these difficulties, I broke down the problem into smaller tasks and implemented them incrementally. I used methods, loops, and conditional statements to handle different scenarios and ensure the system behaved as expected. Debugging and testing played a crucial role in identifying and resolving any issues that arose during development.

Through this project, I not only improved my coding skills but also gained confidence in working with OOP concepts and Java. It provided me with a valuable opportunity to practice problem-solving, code organization, and logical thinking.

Overall, the Simple Banking System project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply my knowledge of OOP, practice implementing complex functionalities, and enhance my overall programming abilities.
